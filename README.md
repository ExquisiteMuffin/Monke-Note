# Monke-Note
Walmart

This is just a beta version that I made for practice.
I will most likely update it or reamke it in a faster and better language

ISSUES:
-Sometimes the app will reopen a second time upon closing
-Text resizing doesn't only resize what you slect, it also resizes the rest of the document
-Program can be slow as it was made in Python (which is a very slow language)
-Limits font options

Great for:
Notetaking and messing around with the themes

Overall, this text editor is pretty garbage, but it was fun to make as a joke and is pretty fun to mess around with.
Enjoy the buggy software!
